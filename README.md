Year Three Engineering Boat Project


Code written for a year 3 Robotic Engineering group project, using an autonomous water vehicle to measure and report back the quality of lake water, as well as collect samples

This code focuses on the communications section of the project, it was written to integrate with other sections, however the other sections are not included in these files, however can be found on my profile.
